# Conjurer

Conjurer is a Flask application intended to manage KVM guests using libvirt. Conjurer should be run from the hypervisor machine
itself.

Conjurer is likely never a project to be used in production. I'm writing this software to learn more about how
libvirt works behind the scenes. I'm also using it as an excuse to learn more complex CI/CD skills and other
automation for software development.
